    <p>Giap Nguyen started Straight to the Point Archery in 2005.  He's an avid and acomplished archer
    himself, having competed with the United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics.  He has
    three children, and started Straight to the Point in part because he was not satisfied with the
    archery education options for the min Tacoma.  After the Hunger Games books and movies came out,
    he noticed a surge in popularity of archery among young people, especially young women, and the
    business has been booming ever since.</p>
