         himself, having competed with the United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics.  He has
         three children, and started Straight to the Point in part because he was not satisfied with the
         archery education options for the min Tacoma.  After the Hunger Games books and movies came out,
         he noticed a surge in popularity of archery among young people, especially young women, and the
         business has been booming ever since.</p>
