    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>Straight to the Point Archery is a non profit archery education center
    founded in 2005 by Giap Nguyen.  Our state of the art educational and training
    facility incorporates detailed technical video analysis combined with generations
    of archery experience from certified coaches and instructors.</p>

    <p>We offer several types of lessons to accommodate everyone from the first time
    archer to the professional archer.  Once set up with proper fitting equipment,
    each archer will be given the basic safety instruction to start and will be introduced
    to various shooting techniques.</p>

    <p>Sign up for a group lesson, private class, schedule a birthday or corporate party or
    compete at one of our many tournaments.  Straight to the Point Archery also offers homeschooling
    programs, kids club events, YMCA classes, Boy and Girl Scouts achievement programs and several
    other youth group activities.</p>
